# World Map

This repository contains the files for my World Map. The point of this project is to create a map that contains various statistics for each country in an easy access, all-in-one place.

## To-Do List

1. Add data to main JSON file. This includes: population data, socioeconomic data, disease data, and more.
2. Remove the border that surrounds the entire map.
3. Make the map zoom in when clicking on a country.
4. Set the max zoom to a smaller number to prevent user from zooming in too far.
5. Look into new map tiles that include smaller islands, ex. Singapore, Comoros, etc.
6. Stylize the top bar for data genres better.
7. Add a scrollable search area on the left side that will contain different types of data for each genre.

### Dependencies

This project uses LeafLet.js to create the map, D3.js for json loading, and FontAwesome for icons.
